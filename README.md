# gimp-palettes
Some palettes for gimp and inkscape. The palettes mainly are intended as a base for military model painting.

I have used different places on the internet to find valuable information. The links listed are used but there will be surely many more.

## How-to use
In a libreoffoce document i have collected all the information and generated a DIMP/INKSCAPE compatible output column.
Just copy the column into a text editor and replace the "+" character with two tab characters '\t\t' and a '-' character with a single tab character '\t'.
